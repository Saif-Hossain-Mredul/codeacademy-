					Front end to back end: Making the switch [Interview]
				</h1>
				<h3 class="intro">
					Are you a front-end developer, thinking about switching from
					front end to back end? We talked with Arnav Luthra, a
					Back-End Software Engineer at Delivery Hero, to find out how
					he made the transition.
				</h3>

				<div class="intro-image"></div>
				<div class="image-description">
					Making the switch from front end to back end can feel
					daunting. It means having to learn new frameworks, new
					languages, and mastering a different way of thinking.
					Luckily, having front-end experience can help set the
					foundation for becoming a back-end developer.
					<br />
					<br />
					According to <a href="#">HackerRank</a>, not only are
					back-end developers in high demand, but hiring managers
					prioritize seeking developers who have a basic understanding
					of all layers of a tech stack. This means that having
					knowledge of the front end can help you become a more
					well-rounded back-end developer.
					<br />
					<br />
					In our interview, Arnav shares why he decided to make the
					switch from front end to back end, and how he made the
					switch. He also shares tips for anyone looking to make the
					switch themselves.

					What do you work on in your current job as a back-end
					engineer?
				</h1>
				<p class="content">
					To kick off our interview, we asked Arnav to tell us more
					about what he does in his current role as a back-end
					engineer at Delivery Hero. “Most of what I do relates to
					implementing business logic on our applications,” Arnav
					explains. He works with his team to build new features and
					maintain existing ones that power their back-end services.
					<br />
					<br />
					“There’s a lot of communication that has to happen between
					us and the Product Managers about what kind of logic we want
					to implement,” he adds. “There’s a lot of attention to
					detail to make sure everything we implement works to the
					degree that we need it to work.”
					<br />
					<br />
					This means Arnav and his team regularly test what they
					build. “It’s a lot of QA (Quality Assurance) to make sure
					that the logic performs as necessary. We do a lot of testing
					of our infrastructure as well, to make sure that our
					applications perform to a certain level of load or demand.”
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h1 class="header">
					What is difference between what a front-end engineer works
					on vs. what a back-end engineer works on?
				</h1>
				<p class="content">
					“Front-end engineering is focused more on what the end user
					sees in an application,” Arnav explains. “So on a primary
					level, it’s the user interface. The work itself is more
					aesthetic-based, you want more of an eye for how things are
					laid out on a page.”
					<br />
					<br />
					“As a back-end engineer, your attention is focused more on
					the logic behind what’s happening in an application. You’re
					providing the data that would then be displayed by the front
					end.”
					<br />
					<br />
					To learn more about the difference between front end vs.
					back end, check out our blog post on
					<a href="#">front end vs. back end</a>.
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h1 class="header">
					Why did you make the switch from front end to back end?
				</h1>
				<p class="content">
					Arnav got his start coding in JavaScript. “That was my first
					software engineering job. When I started looking for new
					jobs, I figured front-end made the most sense for me because
					JavaScript was the language that I was most comfortable
					with.” At the time, Arnav didn’t realize that his work with
					Javascript had spanned both front-end and back-end.
					<br />
					<br />
					His search for front-end roles eventually led him to join
					Delivery Hero as a Front-End Developer. Arnav soon realized,
					however, that he wasn’t doing what he truly enjoyed from his
					last job.
					<br />
					<br />
					“I didn’t quite know the distinction at first, but I
					realized that I tended to enjoy back-end tasks more. I
					wasn’t as interested in the aesthetic side of the
					application, but more so the underlying logic. I found that
					led to problems that were more interesting and fulfilling
					for me to solve.”
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h1 class="header">So, how did you make the switch?</h1>
				<p class="content">
					“My manager was really supportive when I voiced to him that
					I wanted to switch from front end to back end,” Arnav
					explains.
					<br />
					<br />
					“What that entailed was
					<a href="#">learning Go (Golang)</a> learning Go (Golang),
					which is what we use on our back end, working more closely
					with the back-end developers to see what they were doing,
					and learning more about those processes.” <br /><br />
					“It was also switching the way I had to think about
					developing. On the front end, you see the results of your
					work right away because you’re working on the user
					interface, but with back-end it’s a lot more abstract
					numbers that you’re dealing with, so the way that you test
					your work and see the results of your work is more abstract,
					or less easy to see.”
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h1 class="header">
					Do you have any advice for someone who’s interested in a
					career in back-end?
				</h1>
				<p class="content">
					“My advice would be to get experience with front-end as
					well, just to see the difference between the two, and to
					make sure that you’re truly more interested in back-end. For
					me, that was something I wasn’t sure of at the beginning,
					and I valued getting that experience in the front-end first
					to know that back-end was something that I was more
					interested in.”
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h1 class="header">
					Do you have any advice for front-end developers interested
					in switching to back end?
				</h1>
				<p class="content">
					“I think a lot of it comes down to the organization you’re
					working at. Some have a very distinct separation between the
					front-end development teams and the back-end development
					teams, while some have people that go back and forth. In the
					case of my organization, talking to my manager and talking
					to the other back-ends that were working alongside me helped
					me to understand what they were doing.”
					<br /><br />
					“The best thing is to just ask your manager or ask other
					back-end engineers that you might be working with, and see
					if there are any small tasks that you can start with.”
					<br /><br />

					“The biggest hurdle really was just getting the back-end
					environment set up. Once I’d gotten that done, there were a
					lot of small things that I was able to start with that
					helped me build up my knowledge.”
				</p>

				<br />
				<br />

				<h1 class="header">
					What is your favorite part about back-end development?
				</h1>
				<p class="content">
					“My favorite part about back-end development is the problems
					it throws at you. When you’re dealing with powering the
					logic behind an application, there are a lot more algorithms
					involved. It feels almost like you’re solving a puzzle.”
					<br />
					<br />
					“The challenges that back-end development presents in terms
					of having to architect solutions and build efficient code
					challenges you in a different way than front-end development
					does. The challenge is a bit more fulfilling to me.”
