					Front end to back end: Making the switch [Interview]

				<h3 class="intro">
					Are you a front-end developer, thinking about switching from
					front end to back end? We talked with Arnav Luthra, a
					Back-End Software Engineer at Delivery Hero, to find out how
					he made the transition.

					Making the switch from front end to back end can feel
					daunting. It means having to learn new frameworks, new
					languages, and mastering a different way of thinking.
					Luckily, having front-end experience can help set the
					foundation for becoming a back-end developer. 
					<br> 
					<br>
					According to <a href="#">HackerRank</a>, not only are back-end developers in
					high demand, but hiring managers prioritize seeking
					developers who have a basic understanding of all layers of a
					tech stack. This means that having knowledge of the front
					end can help you become a more well-rounded back-end
					developer. 
					<br> 
					<br>
					In our interview, Arnav shares why he decided to
					make the switch from front end to back end, and how he made
					the switch. He also shares tips for anyone looking to make
					the switch themselves.
